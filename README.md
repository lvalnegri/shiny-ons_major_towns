Trying to replicate the *Major Towns and Cities - a new statistical geography* [web map presentation](https://ons.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=fb85539cdc4d4b7d9d34f9560092bb95#).
Also the [Swipe Map](https://ons.maps.arcgis.com/apps/StorytellingSwipe/index.html?appid=33677f5284cc47caa94ce55fa95130b6), once I get the leaflet [side-by-side control](https://github.com/digidem/leaflet-side-by-side) to work in R.
